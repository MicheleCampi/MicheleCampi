Michele Campi
Operations Intelligence Engineer | Parma, Italy

I build solo, full-stack tools that turn complex operational problems into automated decisions — from database architecture to interactive dashboard.

What I build:

→ Production Forecast Engine (PFE PRO)
Browser-based production planning for contract manufacturing. Multi-phase simulation with dependency chains, unified exception management, economic monitoring, Gantt timeline, PDF export. React single-file, zero dependencies, deployed on Vercel.

→ LogiNexus
Last-mile delivery intelligence platform for F&B distribution. 7 integrated modules: graph-powered route optimization (CVRPTW), demand forecasting, anomaly detection, network resilience scoring. Neo4j + OR-Tools + Python FastAPI + React. ~10K lines, solo-built.

Core stack:
Neo4j + GDS | Google OR-Tools (CVRPTW) | Python FastAPI | React
Operations Research | Graph Intelligence | Production Simulation

Problems I solve:
• Modeling complex networks as graphs and extracting intelligence (clustering, resilience, similarity)
• Optimizing vehicle routing with real-world constraints (time windows, capacity, cold chain)
• Simulating multi-phase production with dependency chains and resource constraints
• Forecasting demand with self-calibrating feedback loops
• Building complete products solo — architecture to deployment

Background: 7 years in production control (contract manufacturing, cosmetics sector). Finance & Risk Management degree. Self-taught engineer turning domain expertise into software.

📫 Open to CTO roles, technical co-founder opportunities, and consulting in operations intelligence, graph systems, and production optimization.
