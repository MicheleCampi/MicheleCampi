Michele Campi
Operations Intelligence Engineer | Milan-Bologna, Italy

I build solo, full-stack optimization systems that turn complex operational problems into automated decisions — from OR solver to MCP server to prescriptive advisor.

What I build:

→ OptimEngine — Operations Intelligence Solver (MCP Server)
The first MCP server with 4 levels of optimization intelligence.
L1: Scheduling (FJSP), Routing (CVRPTW), Bin Packing — deterministic optimal.
L2: Sensitivity Analysis, Robust Optimization, Stochastic (Monte Carlo + CVaR).
L2.5: Multi-objective Pareto Frontier with trade-off analysis.
L3: Prescriptive Intelligence — Forecast + Optimize + Risk + Actionable Recommendations.
11 MCP tools, 121 tests, Google OR-Tools, FastAPI, deployed on 9 channels.
Solo-built in 8 days. Free beta: optim-engine-landing.vercel.app

→ PFE PRO — Production Forecast Engine
Browser-based production planning for contract manufacturing.
Multi-phase simulation with dependency chains, economic monitoring, Gantt timeline, PDF export.
React single-file, zero dependencies, deployed on Vercel.

→ LogiNexus — Last-Mile Delivery Intelligence
Graph-powered delivery intelligence for F&B distribution. 7 modules: route optimization (CVRPTW), demand forecasting, anomaly detection, network resilience. Neo4j + OR-Tools + FastAPI + React. ~10K lines, solo-built.

Core stack: Google OR-Tools (CP-SAT, CVRPTW) | Python FastAPI | Monte Carlo + CVaR | Neo4j + GDS | React | MCP Protocol | Pydantic v2 | Docker + Railway

Problems I solve:
- Optimization under uncertainty — sensitivity, robust, stochastic with risk quantification
- Multi-objective trade-off analysis with Pareto frontiers
- Prescriptive intelligence — forecast demand, optimize plans, assess risk, recommend actions
- Vehicle routing with real-world constraints (time windows, capacity, GPS)
- Production scheduling with precedence, machine eligibility, setup times
- Graph-based network intelligence (clustering, resilience, similarity)
- Building complete products solo — architecture to deployment to marketplace distribution

Background: 7 years in production control (contract manufacturing, cosmetics sector). Finance & Risk Management degree. Self-taught engineer turning domain expertise into optimization software.

📫 Open to CTO roles, consulting in operations intelligence, and MCP server development.
