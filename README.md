Michele Campi
Graph Intelligence & Optimization Engineer | Parma, Italy
I build intelligent systems that turn complex operational data into automated decisions — using graph databases, operations research, and predictive analytics.
Core stack: Neo4j + GDS | Google OR-Tools (CVRPTW) | Python FastAPI | React
Problems I solve:

Modeling complex networks as graphs and extracting intelligence (clustering, resilience scoring, similarity)
Optimizing vehicle routing with real-world constraints (time windows, capacity, cold chain, urban zones)
Forecasting demand with self-calibrating feedback loops
Shipping full products solo, from database architecture to interactive dashboard

Currently: Building LogiNexus — a last-mile delivery intelligence platform for F&B distribution. 7 integrated modules, ~10K lines of code, solo-built.
📫 Open to CTO roles, technical co-founder opportunities, and specialized consulting in graph intelligence and optimization systems.
